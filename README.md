Long story short:
I was talking casually with someone about a repo they had and they needed zip support.
I was interested but I had to work on some secret shit I can't tell cos NDA
Sadly, someone else already helped them over, but I still wanna finish this so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

the whole flixel project is a test, if you want the zip file copy the Zip.hx file and the zip folder.

Shoutouts to that guy lmao
